html5 flash card learning application

I wrote this because I am trying to learn Chinese, and I wanted a simple
flashcard application that could run on my phone and work even when I am
off-line, while still being able to synchronize the cards on my PC.

The interesting thing about flashcard-ahhh is that all the data are stored on
the browser, so you don't need to register to a online service in order to save
your cards.

This it not supposed to be a finished product, I release this under GPLv2
licence on github, more as a backup for the project than anything.  If you are
looking for a more advanced flashcard application, check out Anki.
